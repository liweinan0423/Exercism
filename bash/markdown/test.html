<h2>Running the tests</h2>
<p>Each exercise contains a test file.</p>
<p>Run the tests using the `bats` program.</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>bats hello_world.bats</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>`bats` will need to be installed.</p>
<p>
  See the [Testing on the Bash
  track](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/bash/tests) page for
</p>
<p>instructions to install `bats` for your system.</p>
<h2>Help for assert functions</h2>
<p>The tests use functions from the</p>
<p>[bats-assert](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert) library.</p>
<p>Help for the various `assert*` functions can be found there.</p>
<h2>Skipped tests</h2>
<p>Solving an exercise means making all its tests pass. By default, only one</p>
<p>test (the first one) is executed when you run the tests. This is</p>
<p>intentional, as it allows you to focus on just making that one test pass.</p>
<p>
  Once it passes, you can enable the next test by commenting out or removing the
</p>
<p>[[ $BATS<em>RUN</em>SKIPPED == true ]] || skip</p>
<p>annotations prepending other tests.</p>
<p>
  To run all tests, including the ones with `skip` annotations, you can run:
</p>
<p>```bash</p>
<p>BATS<em>RUN</em>SKIPPED=true bats exercise_name.bats</p>
<p>```</p>
<h2>Submitting your solution</h2>
<p>
  You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit markdown.sh` command.
</p>
<p>
  This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the
  solution page's URL.
</p>
<p>It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See how others have completed the exercise</li>
  <li>Request help from a mentor</li>
</ul>
<h2>Need to get help?</h2>
<p>If you'd like help solving the exercise, check the following pages:</p>
<ul>

  </li>

<p>
  Should those resources not suffice, you could submit your (incomplete)
  solution to request mentoring.
</p>
<p>Check your code for syntax errors: paste your code into</p>
<p>
  [https://shellcheck.net](https://shellcheck.net) (or [install
  it](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#user-content-installing) on your
  machine).
</p>
<p>Stack Overflow will be your first stop for bash questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    start with the [`bash` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bash)
    to search for your specific question: it's probably already been asked
  </li>
  <li>
    under the bash tag on Stackoverflow, the [Learn
    more...](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/bash/info) link has <em>tons</em> of
    good information.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>* the "Books and Resources" section is particularly useful.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the [`bash` tag](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bash) on
    Unix & Linux is also active
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>External utilities</h2>
<p>`bash` is a language to write "scripts" -- programs that can call</p>
<p>external tools, such as</p>
<p>[`sed`](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/),</p>
<p>[`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/),</p>
<p>
  [`date`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/date-invocation.html)
</p>
<p>and even programs written in other programming languages,</p>
<p>like [`Python`](https://www.python.org/).</p>
<p>This track does not restrict the usage of these utilities, and as long</p>
<p>as your solution is portable between systems and does not require</p>
<p>installation of third party applications, feel free to use them to solve</p>
<p>the exercise.</p>
<p>
  For an extra challenge, if you would like to have a better understanding of
</p>
<p>
  the language, try to re-implement the solution in pure bash, without using
</p>
<p>
  any external tools. There are some types of problems that bash cannot solve,
</p>
<p>such as floating point arithmetic and manipulating dates: for those, you</p>
